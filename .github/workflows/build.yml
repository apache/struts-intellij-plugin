# GitHub Actions Workflow for CI: testing and verifying the plugin.
# - Validate Gradle Wrapper.
# - Run 'buildPlugin' task and prepare artifact.
# - Run 'test' and 'verifyPlugin' tasks.
# - Run Qodana inspections.
#
# Pre-release publishing is handled by the separate nightly.yml workflow.
#
# The workflow is triggered on push and pull_request events.
